# Ocal — Quick Use Guide (Beach Mode)

## Setup
- Install Expo Go on your phone.
- On your computer: `cd app && npx expo start`, then press `a` to open on the emulator or scan the QR code on your phone.

## Capture (Beach Mode)
- Tap the big **Snap** button. It saves the photo offline and grabs GPS if available.
- Status banner shows “Saved offline”; if GPS is missing it still saves.
- Your finds appear in **Unsorted** (Draft) and in the **Gallery** grid.

## Sorting at home
- Use tabs: **Capture**, **Unsorted**, **Gallery**.
- Unsorted defaults to **Draft** items. Cataloged items are hidden by default.
- Open an item from Unsorted or Gallery.
- Edit **Label**, **Notes**, **Category**, and **Status** (Draft/Cataloged).
- Use **One-tap: Agate + Cataloged** or **Mark Draft** for quick tagging.
- Tap **Save**; changes persist offline.
- To clear Unsorted without deleting, tap **Hide from Unsorted** (marks Cataloged).
- Delete (in Unsorted) removes the photo everywhere, including Gallery.

## Optional Identify (AI)
- In the detail view, tap **Run AI** (secondary button).
- View the best guess and reasons; **Apply tags** can prefill label/category/notes.
- If it errors, you can ignore it—your find is already saved offline.

## Tips
- Works offline for existing collections too; sync is not required for capture or edits.
- If GPS is off/blocked, photos still save; location just shows “no GPS.”
