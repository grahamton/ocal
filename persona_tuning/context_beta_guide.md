# Ocal Beta Testing Guide (v0.9)

Thank you for helping us test **Ocal**, the digital field notebook for beachcombers!

## 🎯 **Testing Focus**

We are specifically looking for feedback on:

1.  **"Ranger Al" Persona**: Is the AI friendly? Does it sound like a knowledgeable park ranger? Is it ever "weird"?
2.  **Accuracy**: Does it correctly identify Agates vs. Sea Glass?
3.  **Stability**: Does the app behave reliably?

## 🧪 **How to Test**

1.  **Go Beachcombing!** (Or use rocks you have at home).
2.  **Snap a Photo**: Use the (+) Capture button.
3.  **Wait for Analysis**: The item will appear in your Gallery. It starts "Rough" (dashed outline) and becomes "Polished" (solid shape) when Ranger Al finishes.
4.  **Review**: Tap the item to see what Al says.

## 🐞 **Reporting Bugs & Feedback**

If something looks wrong, or if you just want to share your session with us:

1.  Go to **Settings** (Gear icon).
2.  Tap **"Export for Analysis"** (Bug icon).
3.  Share the file via **Email** or **Discord** to the developer.

This file contains your finding data and debug logs so we can see exactly what Ranger Al saw and said.

## 📝 **Known Issues**

- "Ask Ranger Al" button might take a few seconds to appear if offline.
- Large text sizes might clip in some menus.

**Thank you for being a part of Ocal!**
