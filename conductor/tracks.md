# Tracks Registry

This file lists all development "tracks" for the Ocal project. A track represents a distinct unit of work, such as implementing a new feature, fixing a major bug, or executing an architectural refactor.

Each track should have its own folder in the `tracks/` directory, containing a detailed `plan.md` and any other relevant artifacts.
