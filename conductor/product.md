# Product Definition: Ocal

## Vision

Ocal is an offline-first, high-contrast rock identification app designed for senior beachcombers on the Pacific Coast. It prioritizes clarity, safety, and field utility over social features or gamification.

The core philosophy is to be a **"Silent Partner in Discovery"**—a helpful companion that feels like a knowledgeable friend, not a complex technical tool.

## Core Personas

1.  **Primary User**: Senior beachcombers who collect rocks as a daily hobby. They value simplicity, readability in bright sunlight, and offline functionality.
2.  **AI Persona**: "Ranger Al," a retired geologist and park ranger who provides explanations in an accessible, engaging, and humble manner.

## Key Features

### 1. Ranger Al Persona
- **Campfire Storyteller**: Explains the geological significance of finds.
- **Safety with Sense**: Provides relevant, immediate safety warnings (e.g., unexploded ordnance) without being alarmist.
- **Humility**: Gracefully admits when it cannot identify a specimen.
- **Senior-Friendly Language**: Uses accessible terminology.

### 2. The Polish Guide (Lapidary Advice)
- A dedicated "Ranger's Workshop" analysis for rock tumbling enthusiasts.
- Provides clear "TUMBLE CANDIDATE" or "SKIP THE TUMBLER" badges based on Mohs hardness and texture.

### 3. Field Journal Ethos
- **High Contrast UI**: Optimized for readability in bright, outdoor conditions.
- **Offline-First**: All core features work without an internet connection.
- **Session-Based Organization**: Groups finds by "sessions" (e.g., a single beach walk) to match the user's mental model.
