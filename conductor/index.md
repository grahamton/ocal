# Ocal Project Conductor

Welcome to the Conductor dashboard for the Ocal project. This system is designed to provide a clear, centralized overview of the project's goals, architecture, and ongoing work.

## Core Documents

- **[Product Definition](./product.md)**: Describes the "what" and "why" of Ocal. What is our vision, who are our users, and what are the core features?

- **[Tech Stack](./tech-stack.md)**: Outlines the technologies, libraries, and architectural patterns used to build the project, along with recommendations for the future.

- **[Tracks Registry](./tracks.md)**: A list of all planned and in-progress work, from new features to bug fixes and architectural changes.

## Workflow

1.  **Define Work**: New features or significant changes are first defined as a "track" in the [Tracks Registry](./tracks.md).
2.  **Plan Track**: Each track gets a detailed implementation plan in its own `tracks/<track-id>/plan.md` file.
3.  **Execute**: Work is executed on a dedicated branch, following the plan.
