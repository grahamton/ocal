# Ocal: The Rock Buddy (v2.0)

**"Your Silent Partner in Discovery"**

Ocal is an offline-first, high-contrast rock identification app designed for senior beachcombers on the Pacific Coast. It prioritizes clarity, safety, and field utility over social features or gamification.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🌲 Ranger Al Persona

The AI doesn't just return data; it acts as **Ranger Al**, a retired geologist and park ranger.

- **Campfire Storyteller**: Explains _why_ the rock matters with deep geologic history.
- **Safety with Sense**: Only warns for immediate dangers (UXO), not for every sharp rock.
- **Humility**: Admits when it's unsure ("It's a bit of a mystery...") rather than guessing.
- **Senior Friendly**: Uses accessible terms like "Shell-like Fracture" and "Volcanic Stone".

### 💎 The Polish Guide (Lapidary Advice)

A dedicated **"Ranger's Workshop"** analysis for rock tumblers.

- **Green Badge**: "TUMBLE CANDIDATE" for hard stones (Agate, Jasper).
- **Red Badge**: "SKIP THE TUMBLER" for soft or porous stones (Basalt, Sandstone).
- **Technical Logic**: Evaluates Mohs hardness and texture to prevent ruining a batch.

### 📓 Field Journal ethos

- **High Contrast**: Designed for bright sunlight readability.
- **Offline First**: Works without cell service (syncs when back online).
- **Masonry Layout**: "Museum Plaque" style presentation of facts.
